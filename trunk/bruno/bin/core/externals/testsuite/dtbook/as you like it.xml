<p>***The Project Gutenberg's Etext of Shakespeare's First Folio***
*************************As you Like it*************************</p>
<p>*****This file should be named 0ws2510.txt or 0ws2510.zip******</p>
<p>Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 0ws2511.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 0ws2510a.txt</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.</p>
<p>Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.</p>

<hd>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</hd>
<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.</p>
<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.</p>
<p>At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.</p>
<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS</p>

<p>This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>
<p>To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE

<p>If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.</p>

<hd>Project Gutenberg's Etext of Shakespeare's The first Part of 
Henry the Sixth</hd>

<p>Executive Director's Notes:</p>
<p>In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
are presented herein:</p>
<p> <q> Barnardo. Who's there?</q>
<q>  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand &amp; vnfold
your selfe</q></p>
<p> <q>  Bar. Long liue the King</q></p>

<p>As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a <em>cliche</em>. . .this is the
original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner.</p>

<p>The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,
as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.</p>

<p>You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
for signing his name with several different spellings.</p>

<p>So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
that are "not" errors. &#x2026;</p>
<p>So&#x2026;with this caveat&#x2026;we have NOT changed the canon errors,
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The first 
Part of Henry the Sixt. </p>

<hd>Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't. </hd>
<p> This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can
come in <acronym>ASCII</acronym> to the printed text.</p>
<p>The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,
punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within
brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may
be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions' best pages.</p>
<p>If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best
etext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
and davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.</p>

<p class="direction">Enter Orlando and Adam.</p>

<p> <span class="speaker">Orlando</span>. As I remember Adam, it was
vpon this fashion bequeathed me by will, but poore a thousand Crownes,
and as thou saist, charged my brother on his blessing to breed mee
well: and there begins my sadnesse: My brother Iaques he keepes at
schoole, and report speakes goldenly of his profit: for my part, he
keepes me rustically at home, or (to speak more properly) staies me
heere at home vnkept: for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
birth, that differs not from the stalling of an Oxe? his horses are
bred better, for besides that they are faire with their feeding, they
are taught their mannage, and to that end Riders deerely hir'd: but I
(his brother) gaine nothing vnder him but growth, for the which his
Animals on his dunghils are as much bound to him as I: besides this
nothing that he so plentifully giues me, the something that nature
gaue mee, his countenance seemes to take from me: hee lets mee feede
with his Hindes, barres mee the place of a brother, and as much as in
him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it Adam that
grieues me, and the spirit of my Father, which I thinke is within mee,
begins to mutinie against this seruitude.  I will no longer endure it,
though yet I know no wise remedy how to auoid it.  Enter Oliuer.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Adam</span>. Yonder comes my Master, your brother</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orlan</span>. Goe a-part Adam, and thou shalt heare how
he will shake me vp</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Now Sir, what make you heere?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. What mar you then sir?</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Marry sir, I am helping you to
mar that which God made, a poore vnworthy brother of yours with
idlenesse</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Oliuer</span>. Marry sir be better employed,
and be naught a while</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orlan</span>. Shall I keepe your hogs, and eat huskes with
them? what prodigall portion haue I spent, that I should
come to such penury?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Know you where you are sir?</p>
  <p><span class="speaker">Orl</span>. O sir, very well: heere in your Orchard</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Know you before whom sir?</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I, better then him I am before
knowes mee: I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle
condition of bloud you should so know me: the courtesie of nations
allowes you my better, in that you are the first borne, but the same
tradition takes not away my bloud, were there twenty brothers betwixt
vs: I haue as much of my father in mee, as you, albeit I confesse your
comming before me is neerer to his reuerence</p>

<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. What Boy</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Come, come elder brother, you are too yong in this</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Wilt thou lay hands on me villaine?</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I am no villaine: I am the
yongest sonne of Sir Rowland de Boys, he was my father, and he is
thrice a villaine that saies such a father begot villaines: wert thou
not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat, till this
other had puld out thy tongue for saying so, thou hast raild on thy
selfe</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Adam</span>. Sweet Masters bee patient, for your Fathers
remembrance, be at accord</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Let me goe I say</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I will not till I please: you
shall heare mee: my father charg'd you in his will to giue me good
education: you haue train'd me like a pezant, obscuring and hiding
from me all gentleman-like qualities: the spirit of my father growes
strong in mee, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow me such
exercises as may become a gentleman, or giue mee the poore allottery
my father left me by testament, with that I will goe buy my
fortunes</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. And what wilt thou do? beg when
that is spent?  Well sir, get you in. I will not long be troubled with
you: you shall haue some part of your will, I pray you leaue me</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I will no further offend you,
then becomes mee for my good</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Get you with him, you olde
dogge</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Adam</span>. Is old dogge my reward: most
true, I haue lost my teeth in your seruice: God be with my olde
master, he would not haue spoke such a word.</p>
<p class="direction">Ex. Orl. Ad.</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Is it euen so, begin you to grow
vpon me? I will physicke your ranckenesse, and yet giue no thousand
crownes neyther: holla Dennis.</p>
<p class="direction">  Enter Dennis.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Den.</span> Calls your worship?</p>
  <p><span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Was not Charles the Dukes
  Wrastler heere to speake with me?  Den. So please you, he is heere
  at the doore, and importunes accesse to you</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Call him in: 'twill be a good
way: and to morrow the wrastling is.  Enter Charles.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Cha</span>. Good morrow to your worship</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Good Mounsier Charles: what's
the new newes at the new Court?  </p>

<p><span class="speaker">Charles</span>. There's no newes at the
Court Sir, but the olde newes: that is, the old Duke is banished by
his yonger brother the new Duke, and three or foure louing Lords haue
put themselues into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and reuenues
enrich the new Duke, therefore he giues them good leaue to wander</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Can you tell if Rosalind the Dukes daughter bee
banished with her Father?</p>
<p>
  <span class="speaker">Cha</span>. O no; for the Dukes daughter her Cosen so
loues her, being euer from their Cradles bred together,
that hee would haue followed her exile, or haue died to
stay behind her; she is at the Court, and no lesse beloued
of her Vncle, then his owne daughter, and neuer two Ladies
loued as they doe</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Where will the old Duke liue?</p>
  <p><span class="speaker">Cha</span>. They say hee is already in the
  Forrest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they liue
  like the old Robin Hood of England: they say many yong Gentlemen
  flocke to him euery day, and fleet the time carelesly as they did in
  the golden world</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. What, you wrastle to morrow
before the new Duke</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cha</span>. Marry doe I sir: and I came to
acquaint you with a matter: I am giuen sir secretly to vnderstand,
that your yonger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in
disguis'd against mee to try a fall: to morrow sir I wrastle for my
credit, and hee that escapes me without some broken limbe, shall
acquit him well: your brother is but young and tender, and for your
loue I would bee loth to foyle him, as I must for my owne honour if
hee come in: therefore out of my loue to you, I came hither to
acquaint you withall, that either you might stay him from his
intendment, or brooke such disgrace well as he shall runne into, in
that it is a thing of his owne search, and altogether against my
will</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Charles , I thanke thee for thy
loue to me, which thou shalt finde I will most kindly requite: I had
my selfe notice of my Brothers purpose heerein, and haue by vnder-hand
meanes laboured to disswade him from it; but he is resolute. Ile tell
thee Charles, it is the stubbornest yong fellow of France, full of
ambition, an enuious emulator of euery mans good parts, a secret &amp;
villanous contriuer against mee his naturall brother: therefore vse
thy discretion, I had as liefe thou didst breake his necke as his
finger. And thou wert best looke to't; for if thou dost him any slight
disgrace, or if hee doe not mightilie grace himselfe on thee, hee will
practise against thee by poyson, entrap thee by some treacherous
deuise, and neuer leaue thee till he hath tane thy life by some
indirect meanes or other: for I assure thee, (and almost with teares I
speake it) there is not one so young, and so villanous this day
liuing. I speake but brotherly of him, but should I anathomize him to
thee, as hee is, I must blush, and weepe, and thou must looke pale and
wonder</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cha</span>. I am heartily glad I came hither
to you: if hee come to morrow, Ile giue him his payment: if euer hee
goe alone againe, Ile neuer wrastle for prize more: and so God keepe
your worship. </p> 
<p class="direction">Exit.</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Farewell good Charles. Now will I stirre this Gamester:
I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soule (yet
I know not why) hates nothing more then he: yet hee's
gentle, neuer school'd, and yet learned, full of noble
deuise, of all sorts enchantingly beloued, and indeed
so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my
owne people, who best know him, that I am altogether
misprised: but it shall not be so long, this wrastler shall
cleare all: nothing remaines, but that I kindle the boy
thither, which now Ile goe about.
Enter.</p>

<h3>Scoena Secunda.</h3>
<p class="direction">Enter Rosalind, and Cellia.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. I pray thee Rosalind, sweet my Coz, be merry</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Deere Cellia; I show more mirth then I am mistresse
of, and would you yet were merrier: vnlesse you
could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
learne mee how to remember any extraordinary pleasure</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Heerein I see thou lou'st mee
not with the full waight that I loue thee; if my Vncle thy banished
father had banished thy Vncle the Duke my Father, so thou hadst beene
still with mee, I could haue taught my loue to take thy father for
mine; so wouldst thou, if the truth of thy loue to me were so
righteously temper'd, as mine is to thee</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Well, I will forget the
condition of my estate, to reioyce in yours</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. You know my Father hath no
childe, but I, nor none is like to haue; and truely when he dies, thou
shalt be his heire; for what hee hath taken away from thy father
perforce, I will render thee againe in affection: by mine honor I
will, and when I breake that oath, let mee turne monster: therefore my
sweet Rose, my deare Rose, be merry</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. From henceforth I will Coz, and
deuise sports: let me see, what thinke you of falling in Loue?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Marry I prethee doe, to make
sport withall: but loue no man in good earnest, nor no further in
sport neyther, then with safety of a pure blush, thou maist in honor
come off againe</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. What shall be our sport then?</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Let vs sit and mocke the good
houswife Fortune from her wheele, that her gifts may henceforth bee
bestowed equally</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I would wee could doe so: for
her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the bountifull blinde woman
doth most mistake in her gifts to women</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. 'Tis true, for those that she
makes faire, she scarce makes honest, &amp; those that she makes
honest, she makes very illfauouredly</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Nay now thou goest from Fortunes
office to Natures: Fortune reignes in gifts of the world, not in the
lineaments of Nature.</p> 
<p class="direction"> Enter Clowne.</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. No; when Nature hath made a
faire creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire? though
nature hath giuen vs wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in
this foole to cut off the argument?  </p>
<p><span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Indeed there is fortune too
hard for nature, when fortune makes natures naturall, the cutter off
of natures witte</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Peraduenture this is not
Fortunes work neither, but Natures, who perceiueth our naturall wits
too dull to reason of such goddesses, hath sent this Naturall for our
whetstone: for alwaies the dulnesse of the foole, is the whetstone of
the wits. How now Witte, whether wander you?  </p>
<p><span class="speaker">Clow</span>. Mistresse, you
must come away to your father</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Were you made the messenger?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. No by mine honor, but I was bid to come for you</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Where learned you that oath foole?</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Of a certaine Knight, that swore
by his Honour they were good Pan-cakes, and swore by his Honor the
Mustard was naught: Now Ile stand to it, the Pancakes were naught, and
the Mustard was good, and yet was not the Knight forsworne</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. How proue you that in the great heape of your
knowledge?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I marry, now vnmuzzle your wisedome</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chinnes,
and sweare by your beards that I am a knaue</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. By our beards (if we had them) thou art</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. By my knauerie (if I had it) then I were: but if
you sweare by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
more was this knight swearing by his Honor, for he neuer
had anie; or if he had, he had sworne it away, before
euer he saw those Pancakes, or that Mustard</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Prethee, who is't that thou means't?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. One that old Fredericke your Father loues</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. My Fathers loue is enough to honor him enough;
speake no more of him, you'l be whipt for taxation one
of these daies</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. The more pittie that fooles may not speak wisely,
what Wisemen do foolishly</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. By my troth thou saiest true: For, since the little
wit that fooles haue was silenced, the little foolerie that
wise men haue makes a great shew; Heere comes Monsieur
the Beu.</p>
<p class="direction">Enter le Beau.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. With his mouth full of newes</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Which he will put on vs, as
Pigeons feed their young</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Then shal we be newes-cram'd</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. All the better: we shalbe the
more Marketable.  Boon-iour Monsieur le Beu, what's the newes?  Le
Beu. Faire Princesse, you haue lost much good sport</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Sport: of what colour?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Le  Beu</span>. What colour Madame? How shall I aunswer
you?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. As wit and fortune will</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Or as the destinies decrees</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Well said, that was laid on with a trowell</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Nay, if I keepe not my ranke</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Thou loosest thy old smell</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Le Beu</span>. You amaze me Ladies: I would haue told
you of good wrastling, which you haue lost the sight of</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Yet tell vs the manner of the Wrastling</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Le Beu</span>. I wil tell you the beginning: and if it please
your Ladiships, you may see the end, for the best is yet
to doe, and heere where you are, they are comming to
performe it</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Well, the beginning that is dead and buried</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Le Beu</span>. There comes an old man, and his three sons</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. I could match this beginning with an old tale</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Le Beu</span>. Three proper yong men, of excellent growth
and presence</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. With bils on their neckes: Be it knowne vnto
all men by these presents</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Le Beu</span>. The eldest of the three, wrastled with Charles
the Dukes Wrastler, which Charles in a moment threw
him, and broke three of his ribbes, that there is little
hope of life in him: So he seru'd the second, and so the
third: yonder they lie, the poore old man their Father,
making such pittiful dole ouer them, that all the beholders
take his part with weeping</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Alas</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. But what is the sport Monsieur, that the Ladies
haue lost?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Le Beu</span>. Why this that I speake of</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Thus men may grow wiser euery day. It is the
first time that euer I heard breaking of ribbes was sport
for Ladies</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Or I, I promise thee</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. But is there any else longs to
see this broken Musicke in his sides? Is there yet another doates vpon
rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrastling Cosin?</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Le Beu</span>. You must if you stay heere,
for heere is the place appointed for the wrastling, and they are ready
to performe it</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Yonder sure they are comming. Let vs now stay
and see it.</p>
<p class="direction">Flourish. Enter Duke, Lords, Orlando, Charles,

<p>  <span class="speaker">Duke</span>. Come on, since the youth will not be intreated
His owne perill on his forwardnesse</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Is yonder the man?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Le Beu</span>. Euen he, Madam</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Alas, he is too yong: yet he looks successefully</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Du</span>. How now daughter, and Cousin:
Are you crept hither to see the wrastling?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I my Liege, so please you giue vs leaue</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Du</span>. You wil take little delight in it, I can tell you
there is such oddes in the man: In pitie of the challengers
youth, I would faine disswade him, but he will not
bee entreated. Speake to him Ladies, see if you can
mooue him</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Call him hether good Monsieuer Le Beu</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Duke</span>. Do so: Ile not be by</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Le Beu</span>. Monsieur the Challenger, the Princesse cals
for you</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I attend them with all respect and dutie</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Young man, haue you challeng'd Charles the
Wrastler?</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. No faire Princesse: he is the
generall challenger, I come but in as others do, to try with him the
strength of my youth</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Yong Gentleman, your spirits are too bold for
your yeares: you haue seene cruell proofe of this mans
strength, if you saw your selfe with your eies, or knew
your selfe with your iudgment, the feare of your aduenture
would counsel you to a more equall enterprise. We
pray you for your owne sake to embrace your own safetie,
and giue ouer this attempt</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Do yong Sir, your reputation shall not therefore
be misprised: we wil make it our suite to the Duke, that
the wrastling might not go forward</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I beseech you, punish mee not with your harde
thoughts, wherein I confesse me much guiltie to denie
so faire and excellent Ladies anie thing. But let your
faire eies, and gentle wishes go with mee to my triall;
wherein if I bee foil'd, there is but one sham'd that was
neuer gracious: if kil'd, but one dead that is willing to
be so: I shall do my friends no wrong, for I haue none to
lament me: the world no iniurie, for in it I haue nothing:
onely in the world I fil vp a place, which may bee better
supplied, when I haue made it emptie</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. The little strength that I haue, I would it were
with you</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. And mine to eeke out hers</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Fare you well: praie heauen I be deceiu'd in you</p>




<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Your hearts desires be with you</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Char</span>. Come, where is this yong gallant, that is so
desirous to lie with his mother earth?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Readie Sir, but his will hath in it a more modest
working</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Duk</span>. You shall trie but one fall</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cha</span>. No, I warrant your Grace you
shall not entreat him to a second, that haue so mightilie perswaded
him from a first</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. You meane to mocke me after: you
should not haue mockt me before: but come your waies</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Now Hercules, be thy speede yong

<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. I would I were inuisible, to

<p class="direction">Wrestle.</p>

<p> <span class="speaker">Duk</span>. No more, no more</p>

<p> <span class="speaker">Duk</span>. How do'st thou Charles?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Le Beu</span>. He cannot speake my Lord</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Duk</span>. Beare him awaie: What is thy
name yong man?</p> 
<p> <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Orlando my Liege, the yongest
sonne of Sir Roland de Boys</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Duk</span>. I would thou hadst beene son to
some man else, The world esteem'd thy father honourable, But I did
finde him still mine enemie: Thou should'st haue better pleas'd me
with this deede, Hadst thou descended from another house: But fare
thee well, thou art a gallant youth, I would thou had'st told me of
another Father.</p>
<p class="direction">Exit Duke.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Were I my Father (Coze) would I do this?
  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I am more proud to be Sir Rolands sonne,
His yongest sonne, and would not change that calling
To be adopted heire to Fredricke</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. My Father lou'd Sir Roland as
his soule, And all the world was of my Fathers minde, Had I before
knowne this yong man his sonne, I should haue giuen him teares vnto
entreaties, Ere he should thus haue ventur'd</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Gentle Cosen, Let vs goe thanke
him, and encourage him: My Fathers rough and enuious disposition
Sticks me at heart: Sir, you haue well deseru'd, If you doe keepe your
promises in loue; But iustly as you haue exceeded all promise, Your
Mistris shall be happie</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Gentleman,
Weare this for me: one out of suites with fortune
That could giue more, but that her hand lacks meanes.
Shall we goe Coze?
  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. I: fare you well faire Gentleman</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Can I not say, I thanke you? My better parts
Are all throwne downe, and that which here stands vp
Is but a quintine, a meere liuelesse blocke</p>

<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. He cals vs back: my pride fell with my fortunes,
Ile aske him what he would: Did you call Sir?
Sir, you haue wrastled well, and ouerthrowne
More then your enemies</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Will you goe Coze?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Haue with you: fare you well.
Enter.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. What passion hangs these waights vpo[n] my toong?
I cannot speake to her, yet she vrg'd conference.</p>
<p class="direction">Enter Le Beu.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>.O poore Orlando! thou art ouerthrowne
Or Charles, or something weaker masters thee</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Le Beu</span>. Good Sir, I do in friendship counsaile you
To leaue this place; Albeit you haue deseru'd
High commendation, true applause, and loue;
Yet such is now the Dukes condition,
That he misconsters all that you haue done:
The Duke is humorous, what he is indeede
More suites you to conceiue, then I to speake of</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I thanke you Sir; and pray you tell me this,
Which of the two was daughter of the Duke,
That here was at the Wrastling?
  Le Beu. Neither his daughter, if we iudge by manners,
But yet indeede the taller is his daughter,
The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,
And here detain'd by her vsurping Vncle
To keepe his daughter companie, whose loues
Are deerer then the naturall bond of Sisters:
But I can tell you, that of late this Duke
Hath tane displeasure 'gainst his gentle Neece,
Grounded vpon no other argument,
But that the people praise her for her vertues,
And pittie her, for her good Fathers sake;
And on my life his malice 'gainst the Lady
Will sodainly breake forth: Sir, fare you well,
Hereafter in a better world then this,
I shall desire more loue and knowledge of you</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
Thus must I from the smoake into the smother,
From tyrant Duke, vnto a tyrant Brother.
But heauenly Rosaline.</p>

<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. But is all this for your Father?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. No, some of it is for my childes Father: Oh

<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. O, a good wish vpon you: you will trie in time
in dispight of a fall: but turning these iests out of seruice,
let vs talke in good earnest: Is it possible on such a sodaine,
you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir
Roulands yongest sonne?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. The Duke my Father lou'd his Father deerelie</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Doth it therefore ensue that you should loue his
Sonne deerelie? By this kinde of chase, I should hate

Because I doe. Looke, here comes the Duke</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. With his eies full of anger</p>

Within these ten daies if that thou beest found
So neere our publike Court as twentie miles,
Thou diest for it</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I doe beseech your Grace
Let me the knowledge of my fault beare with me:
If with my selfe I hold intelligence,
Or haue acquaintance with mine owne desires,
If that I doe not dreame, or be not franticke,
(As I doe trust I am not) then deere Vncle,
Neuer so much as in a thought vnborne,
Did I offend your highnesse</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Duk</span>. Thus doe all Traitors, If their
purgation did consist in words, They are as innocent as grace it
selfe; Let is suffice thee that I trust thee not</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a Traitor;
Tell me whereon the likelihoods depends?
  <span class="speaker">Duk</span>. Thou art thy Fathers daughter, there's enough</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. So was I when your highnes took
his Dukdome, So was I when your highnesse banisht him; Treason is not
inherited my Lord, Or if we did deriue it from our friends, What's
that to me, my Father was no Traitor, Then good my Leige, mistake me
not so much, To thinke my pouertie is treacherous</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Deere Soueraigne heare me speake</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Duk</span>. I Celia, we staid her for your sake,
Else had she with her Father rang'd along</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. I did not then intreat to haue
her stay, It was your pleasure, and your owne remorse, I was too yong
that time to value her, But now I know her: if she be a Traitor, Why
so am I: we still haue slept together, Rose at an instant, learn'd,
plaid, eate together, And wheresoere we went, like Iunos Swans, Still
we went coupled and inseperable</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Duk</span>. She is too subtile for thee, and

she is gone: then open not thy lips Firme, and irreuocable is my

<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Pronounce that sentence then on

Shall we be sundred? shall we part sweete girle?
No, let my Father seeke another heire:
Therefore deuise with me how we may flie
Whether to goe, and what to beare with vs,
And doe not seeke to take your change vpon you,
To beare your griefes your selfe, and leaue me out:

<h3>Scoena Prima.</h3>
<p class="direction">Enter Duke Senior: Amyens, and two or three Lords like
Forresters.</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Duk.Sen</span>. Now my Coe-mates, and
brothers in exile: Hath not old custome made this life more sweete
Then that of painted pompe? Are not these woods More free from perill
then the enuious Court?  Heere feele we not the penaltie of Adam, The
seasons difference, as the Icie phange And churlish chiding of the
winters winde, Which when it bites and blowes vpon my body Euen till I
shrinke with cold, I smile, and say This is no flattery: these are
counsellors That feelingly perswade me what I am: Sweet are the vses
of aduersitie Which like the toad, ougly and venemous, Weares yet a
precious Iewell in his head: And this our life exempt from publike
haunt, Findes tongues in trees, bookes in the running brookes, Sermons
in stones, and good in euery thing</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Amien</span>. I would not change it, happy is your Grace
That can translate the stubbornnesse of fortune
Into so quiet and so sweet a stile</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Du.Sen.</span> Come, shall we goe and kill
vs venison?  And yet it irkes me the poore dapled fooles Being natiue
Burgers of this desert City, Should in their owne confines with forked
heads Haue their round hanches goard</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">1.Lord.</span> Indeed my Lord The melancholy Iaques grieues at that, And
in that kinde sweares you doe more vsurpe Then doth your brother that
hath banish'd you: To day my Lord of Amiens, and my selfe, Did steale
behinde him as he lay along Vnder an oake, whose anticke roote peepes
out Vpon the brooke that brawles along this wood, To the which place a
poore sequestred Stag That from the Hunters aime had tane a hurt, Did
come to languish; and indeed my Lord The wretched annimall heau'd
forth such groanes That their discharge did stretch his leatherne coat
Almost to bursting, and the big round teares Cours'd one another downe
his innocent nose In pitteous chase: and thus the hairie foole, Much
marked of the melancholie Iaques, Stood on th' extremest verge of the
swift brooke, Augmenting it with teares</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Du.Sen.</span> But what said Iaques?  Did he
not moralize this spectacle?  1.Lord. O yes, into a thousand similies.
First, for his weeping into the needlesse streame; Poore Deere quoth
he, thou mak'st a testament As worldlings doe, giuing thy sum of more
To that which had too much: then being there alone, Left and abandoned
of his veluet friend; 'Tis right quoth he, thus miserie doth part The
Fluxe of companie: anon a carelesse Heard Full of the pasture, iumps
along by him And neuer staies to greet him: I quoth Iaques, Sweepe on
you fat and greazie Citizens, 'Tis iust the fashion; wherefore doe you
looke Vpon that poore and broken bankrupt there?  Thus most
inuectiuely he pierceth through The body of Countrie, Citie, Court,
Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we Are meere vsurpers,
tyrants, and whats worse To fright the Annimals, and to kill them vp
In their assign'd and natiue dwelling place</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">D.Sen</span>. And did you leaue him in this contemplation?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">2.Lord</span>. We did my Lord, weeping and commenting
Vpon the sobbing Deere</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Du.Sen.</span> Show me the place,
I loue to cope him in these sullen fits,
For then he's full of matter</p>

And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?  Why would you be
so fond to ouercome The bonnie priser of the humorous Duke?  Your
praise is come too swiftly home before you.  Know you not Master, to
seeme kinde of men, Their graces serue them but as enemies, No more

Your brother, no, no brother, yet the sonne (Yet not the son, I will

your praises, and this night he meanes, To burne the lodging where you
vse to lye, And you within it: if he faile of that He will haue other
meanes to cut you off; I ouerheard him: and his practises: This is no

that doth the Rauens feede, Yea prouidently caters for the Sparrow, Be
comfort to my age: here is the gold, All this I giue you, let me be
your seruant, Though I looke old, yet I am strong and lustie; For in
my youth I neuer did apply Hot, and rebellious liquors in my bloud,
Nor did not with vnbashfull forehead woe, The meanes of weaknesse and
debilitie, Therefore my age is as a lustie winter, Frostie, but
kindely; let me goe with you, Ile doe the seruice of a yonger man In

choake their seruice vp, Euen with the hauing, it is not so with thee:
But poore old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree, That cannot so much as

as I doe now, Wearing thy hearer in thy Mistris praise, Thou hast not
lou'd.  Or if thou hast not broke from companie, Abruptly as my
passion now makes me, Thou hast not lou'd.  O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe.
Enter.</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Alas poore Shepheard searching

<p> <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. And I mine: I remember when I
was in loue, I broke my sword vpon a stone, and bid him take that for
comming a night to Iane Smile, and I remember the kissing of her
batler, and the Cowes dugs that her prettie chopt hands had milk'd;
and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I
tooke two cods, and giuing her them againe, said with weeping teares,
weare these for my sake: wee that are true Louers, runne into strange
capers; but as all is mortall in nature, so is all nature in loue,
mortall in folly</p>

Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
Bring vs where we may rest our selues, and feed:
Here's a yong maid with trauaile much oppressed,

<p> <span class="speaker">Cor</span> Faire Sir, I pittie her, And wish
for her sake more then for mine owne, My fortunes were more able to
releeue her: But I am shepheard to another man, And do not sheere the
Fleeces that I graze: My master is of churlish disposition, And little
wreakes to finde the way to heauen By doing deeds of hospitalitie.
Besides his Coate, his Flockes, and bounds of feede Are now on sale,
and at our sheep-coat now By reason of his absence there is nothing
That you will feed on: but what is, come see, And in my voice most
welcome shall you be</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. What is he that shall buy his flocke and pasture?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Cor</span> That yong Swaine that you saw heere but erewhile,
That little cares for buying any thing</p>

Buy thou the Cottage, pasture, and the flocke,
And thou shalt haue to pay for it of vs</p>

I like this place, and willingly could
Waste my time in it</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cor</span> Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
Go with me, if you like vpon report,

Heere was he merry, hearing of a Song</p>

That your poore friends must woe your companie,
What, you looke merrily</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. A Foole, a foole: I met a foole
i'th Forrest, A motley Foole (a miserable world:) As I do liue by
foode, I met a foole, Who laid him downe, and bask'd him in the Sun,
And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good termes, In good set termes, and yet
a motley foole.  Good morrow foole (quoth I:) no Sir, quoth he, Call
me not foole, till heauen hath sent me fortune, And then he drew a
diall from his poake, And looking on it, with lacke-lustre eye, Sayes,
very wisely, it is ten a clocke: Thus we may see (quoth he) how the
world wagges: 'Tis but an houre agoe, since it was nine, And after one
houre more, 'twill be eleuen, And so from houre to houre, we ripe, and
ripe, And then from houre to houre, we rot, and rot, And thereby hangs
a tale. When I did heare The motley Foole, thus morall on the time, My
Lungs began to crow like Chanticleere, That Fooles should be so deepe
contemplatiue: And I did laugh, sans intermission An houre by his
diall. Oh noble foole, A worthy foole: Motley's the onely weare</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Du.Sen</span>. What foole is this?</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. O worthie Foole: One that hath
bin a Courtier And sayes, if Ladies be but yong, and faire, They haue
the gift to know it: and in his braine, Which is as drie as the
remainder bisket After a voyage: He hath strange places cram'd With
obseruation, the which he vents In mangled formes. O that I were a
foole, I am ambitious for a motley coat</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Du.Sen</span>. Thou shalt haue one</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. It is my onely suite, Prouided
that you weed your better iudgements Of all opinion that growes ranke
in them, That I am wise. I must haue liberty Withall, as large a
Charter as the winde, To blow on whom I please, for so fooles haue:
And they that are most gauled with my folly, They most must laugh: And
why sir must they so?  The why is plaine, as way to Parish Church:
Hee, that a Foole doth very wisely hit, Doth very foolishly, although
he smart Seeme senselesse of the bob. If not, The Wise-mans folly is
anathomiz'd Euen by the squandring glances of the foole.  Inuest me in
my motley: Giue me leaue To speake my minde, and I will through and
through Cleanse the foule bodie of th' infected world, If they will
patiently receiue my medicine</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Du.Sen</span>. Fie on thee. I can tell what thou wouldst do</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. What, for a Counter, would I do, but good?
  <span class="speaker">Du.Sen</span>. Most mischeeuous foule sin, in chiding sin:
For thou thy selfe hast bene a Libertine,
As sensuall as the brutish sting it selfe,
And all th' imbossed sores, and headed euils,
That thou with license of free foot hast caught,
Would'st thou disgorge into the generall world</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. Why who cries out on pride,
That can therein taxe any priuate party:
Doth it not flow as hugely as the Sea,
Till that the wearie verie meanes do ebbe.
What woman in the Citie do I name,
When that I say the City woman beares
The cost of Princes on vnworthy shoulders?
Who can come in, and say that I meane her,
When such a one as shee, such is her neighbor?
Or what is he of basest function,
That sayes his brauerie is not on my cost,
Thinking that I meane him, but therein suites
His folly to the mettle of my speech,
There then, how then, what then, let me see wherein
My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
Then he hath wrong'd himselfe: if he be free,
Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies
Vnclaim'd of any man. But who come here?

Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
That in ciuility thou seem'st so emptie?
  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. You touch'd my veine at first, the thorny point
Of bare distresse, hath tane from me the shew
Of smooth ciuility: yet am I in-land bred,
And know some nourture: But forbeare, I say,
He dies that touches any of this fruite,
Till I, and my affaires are answered</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. And you will not be answer'd with reason,
I must dye</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Du.Sen</span>. What would you haue?
Your gentlenesse shall force, more then your force
Moue vs to gentlenesse</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I almost die for food, and let me haue it</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Du.Sen</span>. Sit downe and feed, &amp; welcom to our table
  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Speake you so gently? Pardon me I pray you,
I thought that all things had bin sauage heere,
And therefore put I on the countenance
Of sterne command'ment. But what ere you are
That in this desert inaccessible,
Vnder the shade of melancholly boughes,
Loose, and neglect the creeping houres of time:
If euer you haue look'd on better dayes:
If euer beene where bels haue knoll'd to Church:
If euer sate at any good mans feast:
If euer from your eye-lids wip'd a teare,
And know what 'tis to pittie, and be pittied:
Let gentlenesse my strong enforcement be,
In the which hope, I blush, and hide my Sword</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Du.Sen</span>. True is it, that we haue seene better dayes,
And haue with holy bell bin knowld to Church,
And sat at good mens feasts, and wip'd our eies
Of drops, that sacred pity hath engendred:
And therefore sit you downe in gentlenesse,
And take vpon command, what helpe we haue
That to your wanting may be ministred</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Then but forbeare your food a little while:
Whiles (like a Doe) I go to finde my Fawne,
And giue it food. There is an old poore man,
Who after me, hath many a weary steppe
Limpt in pure loue: till he be first suffic'd,
Opprest with two weake euils, age, and hunger,
I will not touch a bit</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Duke Sen</span>. Go finde him out,
And we will nothing waste till you returne</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I thanke ye, and be blest for your good comfort</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Du.Sen</span>. Thou seest, we are not all alone vnhappie:
This wide and vniuersall Theater
Presents more wofull Pageants then the Sceane
Wherein we play in</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ia</span>. All the world's a stage, And all
the men and women, meerely Players; They haue their Exits and their
Entrances, And one man in his time playes many parts, His Acts being
seuen ages. At first the Infant, Mewling, and puking in the Nurses
armes: Then, the whining Schoole-boy with his Satchell And shining
morning face, creeping like snaile Vnwillingly to schoole. And then
the Louer, Sighing like Furnace, with a wofull ballad Made to his
Mistresse eye-brow. Then, a Soldier, Full of strange oaths, and
bearded like the Pard, Ielous in honor, sodaine, and quicke in
quarrell, Seeking the bubble Reputation Euen in the Canons mouth: And
then, the Iustice In faire round belly, with good Capon lin'd, With
eyes seuere, and beard of formall cut, Full of wise sawes, and moderne
instances, And so he playes his part. The sixt age shifts Into the
leane and slipper'd Pantaloone, With spectacles on nose, and pouch on
side, His youthfull hose well sau'd, a world too wide, For his shrunke
shanke, and his bigge manly voice, Turning againe toward childish
trebble pipes, And whistles in his sound. Last Scene of all, That ends
this strange euentfull historie, Is second childishnesse, and meere
obliuion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans euery thing.  Enter
Orlando with Adam.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Du.Sen</span>. Welcome: set downe your venerable burthen,
and let him feede</p>

I scarce can speake to thanke you for my selfe</p>

<p> <span class="speaker">Du</span>. Not see him since? Sir, sir, that

Finde out thy brother wheresoere he is, Seeke him with Candle: bring

<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Hang there my verse, in witnesse of my loue,
And thou thrice crowned Queene of night suruey
With thy chaste eye, from thy pale spheare aboue
Thy Huntresse name, that my full life doth sway.
O Rosalind, these Trees shall be my Bookes,
And in their barkes my thoughts Ile charracter,

Run, run Orlando, carue on euery Tree,

<p class="direction">Exit</p>
<p class="direction">Enter Corin &amp; Clowne.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Co</span>. And how like you this shepherds life Mr Touchstone?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Clow</span>. Truely Shepheard, in respect of it selfe, it is a
good life; but in respect that it is a shepheards life, it is
naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it verie well:
but in respect that it is priuate, it is a very vild life. Now
in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth mee well: but in
respect it is not in the Court, it is tedious. As it is a spare
life (looke you) it fits my humor well: but as there is no
more plentie in it, it goes much against my stomacke.
Has't any Philosophie in thee shepheard?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Cor</span> No more, but that I know the more one sickens,
the worse at ease he is: and that hee that wants money,
meanes, and content, is without three good frends. That
the propertie of raine is to wet, and fire to burne: That
good pasture makes fat sheepe: and that a great cause of
the night, is lacke of the Sunne: That hee that hath learned
no wit by Nature, nor Art, may complaine of good
breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Such a one is a naturall Philosopher:
Was't euer in Court, Shepheard?
  <span class="speaker">Cor</span> No truly</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Then thou art damn'd</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cor</span> Nay, I hope</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Truly thou art damn'd, like an ill roasted Egge,
all on one side</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cor</span> For not being at Court? your reason</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Why, if thou neuer was't at Court, thou neuer
saw'st good manners: if thou neuer saw'st good maners,
then thy manners must be wicked, and wickednes is sin,
and sinne is damnation: Thou art in a parlous state shepheard</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cor</span> Not a whit Touchstone, those that are good maners
at the Court, are as ridiculous in the Countrey, as
the behauiour of the Countrie is most mockeable at the
Court. You told me, you salute not at the Court, but
you kisse your hands; that courtesie would be vncleanlie
if Courtiers were shepheards</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Instance, briefly: come, instance</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cor</span> Why we are still handling our Ewes, and their
Fels you know are greasie</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Why do not your Courtiers hands sweate? and
is not the grease of a Mutton, as wholesome as the sweat
of a man? Shallow, shallow: A better instance I say:
Come</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cor</span> Besides, our hands are hard</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Your lips wil feele them the sooner. Shallow agen:
a more sounder instance, come</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cor</span> And they are often tarr'd ouer, with the surgery
of our sheepe: and would you haue vs kisse Tarre? The
Courtiers hands are perfum'd with Ciuet</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Most shallow man: Thou wormes meate in respect
of a good peece of flesh indeed: learne of the wise
and perpend: Ciuet is of a baser birth then Tarre, the
verie vncleanly fluxe of a Cat. Mend the instance Shepheard</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cor</span> You haue too Courtly a wit, for me, Ile rest</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God helpe thee shallow
man: God make incision in thee, thou art raw</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cor</span> Sir, I am a true Labourer, I earne that I eate: get
that I weare; owe no man hate, enuie no mans happinesse:
glad of other mens good content with my harme:
and the greatest of my pride, is to see my Ewes graze, &amp;
my Lambes sucke</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. That is another simple sinne in you, to bring the
Ewes and the Rammes together, and to offer to get your
liuing, by the copulation of Cattle, to be bawd to a Belweather,
and to betray a shee-Lambe of a tweluemonth
to a crooked-pated olde Cuckoldly Ramme, out of all
reasonable match. If thou bee'st not damn'd for this, the
diuell himselfe will haue no shepherds, I cannot see else
how thou shouldst scape</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cor</span> Heere comes yong Mr Ganimed, my new Mistrisses
Brother.</p>
<p class="direction">Enter Rosalind</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. From the east to westerne Inde,
no iewel is like Rosalinde, Hir worth being mounted on the winde,
through all the world beares Rosalinde.  All the pictures fairest
Linde, are but blacke to Rosalinde: Let no face bee kept in mind, but
the faire of Rosalinde</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Ile rime you so, eight yeares together; dinners,
and suppers, and sleeping hours excepted: it is the right
Butter-womens ranke to Market</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Out Foole</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. For a taste.  If a Hart doe
lacke a Hinde, Let him seeke out Rosalinde: If the Cat will after
kinde, so be sure will Rosalinde: Wintred garments must be linde, so
must slender Rosalinde: They that reap must sheafe and binde, then to
cart with Rosalinde.  Sweetest nut, hath sowrest rinde, such a nut is
Rosalinde.  He that sweetest rose will finde, must finde Loues pricke,
&amp; Rosalinde.  This is the verie false gallop of Verses, why doe
you infect your selfe with them?</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Peace you dull foole, I found
them on a tree</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Truely the tree yeelds bad fruite</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Ile graffe it with you, and then
I shall graffe it with a Medler: then it will be the earliest fruit
i'th country: for you'l be rotten ere you bee halfe ripe, and that's
the right vertue of the Medler</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. You haue said: but whether
wisely or no, let the Forrest iudge.  Enter Celia with a writing.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Peace, here comes my sister reading, stand aside</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Why should this Desert bee, for
it is vnpeopled? Noe: Tonges Ile hang on euerie tree, that shall
ciuill sayings shoe.  Some, how briefe the Life of man runs his erring
pilgrimage, That the stretching of a span, buckles in his summe of
age.  Some of violated vowes, twixt the soules of friend, and friend:
But vpon the fairest bowes, or at euerie sentence end; Will I
Rosalinda write, teaching all that reade, to know The quintessence of
euerie sprite, heauen would in little show.  Therefore heauen Nature
charg'd, that one bodie should be fill'd With all Graces wide
enlarg'd, nature presently distill'd Helens cheeke, but not his heart,
Cleopatra's Maiestie: Attalanta's better part, sad Lucrecia's
Modestie.  Thus Rosalinde of manie parts, by Heauenly Synode was
deuis'd, Of manie faces, eyes, and hearts, to haue the touches deerest
pris'd.  Heauen would that shee these gifts should haue, and I to liue
and die her slaue</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. O most gentle Iupiter, what
tedious homilie of Loue haue you wearied your parishioners withall,
and neuer cri'de, haue patience good people</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. How now backe friends:
Shepheard, go off a little: go with him sirrah</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Come Shepheard, let vs make an
honorable retreit, though not with bagge and baggage, yet with scrip
and scrippage.  Enter.</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Didst thou heare these verses?
<span class="speaker">Ros</span>. O yes, I heard them all, and more
too, for some of them had in them more feete then the Verses would
beare</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. That's no matter: the feet might
beare y verses</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I, but the feet were lame, and
could not beare themselues without the verse, and therefore stood
lamely in the verse</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. But didst thou heare without
wondering, how thy name should be hang'd and carued vpon these trees?
<span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I was seuen of the nine daies out of
the wonder, before you came: for looke heere what I found on a Palme
tree; I was neuer so berim'd since Pythagoras time that I was an Irish
Rat, which I can hardly remember</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Tro you, who hath done this?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Is it a man?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. And a chaine that you once wore about his neck:
change you colour?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I pre'thee who?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to
meete; but Mountaines may bee remoou'd with Earthquakes,
and so encounter</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Nay, but who is it?
  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Is it possible?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Nay, I pre'thee now, with most petitionary vehemence,
tell me who it is</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. O wonderfull, wonderfull, and most wonderfull
wonderfull, and yet againe wonderful, and after that out
of all hooping</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Good my complection, dost thou
think though I am caparison'd like a man, I haue a doublet and hose in
my disposition? One inch of delay more, is a South-sea of
discouerie. I pre'thee tell me, who is it quickely, and speake apace:
I would thou couldst stammer, that thou might'st powre this conceal'd
man out of thy mouth, as Wine comes out of a narrow-mouth'd bottle:
either too much at once, or none at all. I pre'thee take the Corke out
of thy mouth, that I may drinke thy tydings</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. So you may put a man in your belly</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Is he of Gods making? What manner of man?
Is his head worth a hat? Or his chin worth a beard?
  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Nay, he hath but a little beard</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Why God will send more, if the man will bee
thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou
delay me not the knowledge of his chin</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. It is yong Orlando, that tript vp the Wrastlers
heeles, and your heart, both in an instant</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Nay, but the diuell take mocking: speake sadde
brow, and true maid</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. I'faith (Coz) tis he</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Orlando?
  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Orlando</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Alas the day, what shall I do with my doublet &amp;
hose? What did he when thou saw'st him? What sayde
he? How look'd he? Wherein went he? What makes hee
heere? Did he aske for me? Where remaines he? How
parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him againe?
Answer me in one word</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. You must borrow me Gargantuas mouth first:
'tis a Word too great for any mouth of this Ages size, to
say I and no, to these particulars, is more then to answer
in a Catechisme</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. But doth he know that I am in this Forrest, and
in mans apparrell? Looks he as freshly, as he did the day
he Wrastled?
  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. It is as easie to count Atomies as to resolue the
propositions of a Louer: but take a taste of my finding
him, and rellish it with good obseruance. I found him
vnder a tree like a drop'd Acorne</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. It may wel be cal'd Ioues tree, when it droppes
forth fruite</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Giue me audience, good Madam</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Proceed</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. There lay hee stretch'd along like a Wounded
knight</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Though it be pittie to see such a sight, it well
becomes the ground</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Cry holla, to the tongue, I prethee: it curuettes
vnseasonably. He was furnish'd like a Hunter</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. O ominous, he comes to kill my Hart</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. I would sing my song without a burthen, thou
bring'st me out of tune</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Do you not know I am a woman, when I thinke,
I must speake: sweet, say on.
Enter Orlando &amp; Iaques.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. You bring me out. Soft, comes he not heere?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. 'Tis he, slinke by, and note him</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. I thanke you for your company, but good faith
I had as liefe haue beene my selfe alone</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. And so had I: but yet for fashion sake
I thanke you too, for your societie</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. God buy you, let's meet as little as we can</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I do desire we may be better strangers</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. I pray you marre no more trees with Writing
Loue-songs in their barkes</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I pray you marre no moe of my verses with reading
them ill-fauouredly</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. Rosalinde is your loues name?
  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Yes, Iust</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. I do not like her name</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. There was no thought of pleasing you when she
was christen'd</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. What stature is she of?
  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Iust as high as my heart</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. You are ful of prety answers: haue you not bin acquainted
with goldsmiths wiues, &amp; cond the[m] out of rings
  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Not so: but I answer you right painted cloath,
from whence you haue studied your questions</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. You haue a nimble wit; I thinke 'twas made of
Attalanta's heeles. Will you sitte downe with me, and
wee two, will raile against our Mistris the world, and all
our miserie</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I wil chide no breather in the world but my selfe
against whom I know most faults</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. The worst fault you haue, is to be in loue</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. 'Tis a fault I will not change, for your best vertue:
I am wearie of you</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. By my troth, I was seeking for a Foole, when I
found you</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. He is drown'd in the brooke, looke but in, and
you shall see him</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. There I shal see mine owne figure</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Which I take to be either a foole, or a Cipher</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. Ile tarrie no longer with you, farewell good signior
Loue</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I am glad of your departure: Adieu good Monsieur
Melancholly</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I wil speake to him like a sawcie Lacky, and vnder
that habit play the knaue with him, do you hear Forrester</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Verie wel, what would you?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I pray you, what i'st a clocke?
  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. You should aske me what time o' day: there's no
clocke in the Forrest</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Then there is no true Louer in the Forrest, else
sighing euerie minute, and groaning euerie houre wold
detect the lazie foot of time, as wel as a clocke</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. And why not the swift foote of time? Had not
that bin as proper?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. By no meanes sir; Time trauels in diuers paces,
with diuers persons: Ile tel you who Time ambles withall,
who Time trots withal, who Time gallops withal,
and who he stands stil withall</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I prethee, who doth he trot withal?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Marry he trots hard with a yong maid, between
the contract of her marriage, and the day it is solemnizd:
if the interim be but a sennight, Times pace is so hard,
that it seemes the length of seuen yeare</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Who ambles Time withal?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. With a Priest that lacks Latine, and a rich man
that hath not the Gowt: for the one sleepes easily because
he cannot study, and the other liues merrily, because
he feeles no paine: the one lacking the burthen of
leane and wasteful Learning; the other knowing no burthen
of heauie tedious penurie. These Time ambles
withal</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Who doth he gallop withal?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. With a theefe to the gallowes: for though hee
go as softly as foot can fall, he thinkes himselfe too soon
there</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Who staies it stil withal?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. With Lawiers in the vacation: for they sleepe
betweene Terme and Terme, and then they perceiue not
how time moues</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Where dwel you prettie youth?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. With this Shepheardesse my sister: heere in the
skirts of the Forrest, like fringe vpon a petticoat</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Are you natiue of this place?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. As the Conie that you see dwell where shee is
kindled</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Your accent is something finer, then you could
purchase in so remoued a dwelling</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I haue bin told so of many: but indeed, an olde
religious Vnckle of mine taught me to speake, who was
in his youth an inland man, one that knew Courtship too
well: for there he fel in loue. I haue heard him read many
Lectors against it, and I thanke God, I am not a Woman
to be touch'd with so many giddie offences as hee
hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Can you remember any of the principall euils,
that he laid to the charge of women?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. There were none principal, they were all like
one another, as halfepence are, euerie one fault seeming
monstrous, til his fellow-fault came to match it</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I prethee recount some of them</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. No: I wil not cast away my physick, but on those
that are sicke. There is a man haunts the Forrest, that abuses
our yong plants with caruing Rosalinde on their
barkes; hangs Oades vpon Hauthornes, and Elegies on
brambles; all (forsooth) defying the name of Rosalinde.
If I could meet that Fancie-monger, I would giue him
some good counsel, for he seemes to haue the Quotidian
of Loue vpon him</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I am he that is so Loue-shak'd, I pray you tel
me your remedie</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. There is none of my Vnckles markes vpon you:
he taught me how to know a man in loue: in which cage
of rushes, I am sure you art not prisoner</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. What were his markes?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. A leane cheeke, which you haue not: a blew eie
and sunken, which you haue not: an vnquestionable spirit,
which you haue not: a beard neglected, which you
haue not: (but I pardon you for that, for simply your hauing
in beard, is a yonger brothers reuennew) then your
hose should be vngarter'd, your bonnet vnbanded, your
sleeue vnbutton'd, your shoo vnti'de, and euerie thing
about you, demonstrating a carelesse desolation: but you
are no such man; you are rather point deuice in your
accoustrements,
as louing your selfe, then seeming the Louer
of any other</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Faire youth, I would I could make thee beleeue I Loue</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Me beleeue it? You may assoone make her that
you Loue beleeue it, which I warrant she is apter to do,
then to confesse she do's: that is one of the points, in the
which women stil giue the lie to their consciences. But
in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the
Trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired?
  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I sweare to thee youth, by the white hand of
Rosalind, I am that he, that vnfortunate he</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. But are you so much in loue, as your rimes speak?
  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Neither rime nor reason can expresse how much</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Loue is meerely a madnesse, and I tel you, deserues
as wel a darke house, and a whip, as madmen do:
and the reason why they are not so punish'd and cured, is
that the Lunacie is so ordinarie, that the whippers are in
loue too: yet I professe curing it by counsel</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Did you euer cure any so?
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Yes one, and in this manner. Hee was to imagine
me his Loue, his Mistris: and I set him euerie day
to woe me. At which time would I, being but a moonish
youth, greeue, be effeminate, changeable, longing, and
liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, ful
of teares, full of smiles; for euerie passion something, and
for no passion truly any thing, as boyes and women are
for the most part, cattle of this colour: would now like
him, now loath him: then entertaine him, then forswear
him: now weepe for him, then spit at him; that I draue
my Sutor from his mad humor of loue, to a liuing humor
of madnes, w was to forsweare the ful stream of y world,
and to liue in a nooke meerly Monastick: and thus I cur'd
him, and this way wil I take vpon mee to wash your Liuer
as cleane as a sound sheepes heart, that there shal not
be one spot of Loue in't</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I would not be cured, youth</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind,
and come euerie day to my Coat, and woe me</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orlan</span>. Now by the faith of my loue, I will; Tel me
where it is</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Go with me to it, and Ile shew it you: and by
the way, you shal tell me, where in the Forrest you liue:
Wil you go?
  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. With all my heart, good youth</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Nay, you must call mee Rosalind: Come sister,
will you go?</p>

<p class="direction">Enter Clowne, Audrey, &amp; Iaques.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Come apace good Audrey, I wil fetch vp your
Goates, Audrey: and how Audrey am I the man yet?
Doth my simple feature content you?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Aud</span>. Your features, Lord warrant vs: what features?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. I am heere with thee, and thy Goats, as the most
capricious Poet honest Ouid was among the Gothes</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. O knowledge ill inhabited, worse then Ioue in
a thatch'd house</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. When a mans verses cannot be vnderstood, nor
a mans good wit seconded with the forward childe, vnderstanding:
it strikes a man more dead then a great reckoning
in a little roome: truly, I would the Gods hadde
made thee poeticall</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Aud</span>. I do not know what Poetical is: is it honest in
deed and word: is it a true thing?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. No trulie: for the truest poetrie is the most faining,
and Louers are giuen to Poetrie: and what they
sweare in Poetrie, may be said as Louers, they do feigne</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Aud</span>. Do you wish then that the Gods had made me
Poeticall?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Clow</span>. I do truly: for thou swear'st to me thou art honest:
Now if thou wert a Poet, I might haue some hope
thou didst feigne</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Aud</span>. Would you not haue me honest?
  <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. No truly, vnlesse thou wert hard fauour'd: for
honestie coupled to beautie, is to haue Honie a sawce to
Sugar</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. A materiall foole</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Aud</span>. Well, I am not faire, and therefore I pray the
Gods make me honest</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Truly, and to cast away honestie vppon a foule
slut, were to put good meate into an vncleane dish</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Aud</span>. I am not a slut, though I thanke the Goddes I
am foule</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Well, praised be the Gods, for
thy foulnesse; sluttishnesse may come heereafter. But be it, as it may
bee, I wil marrie thee: and to that end, I haue bin with Sir Oliuer
Mar-text, the Vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meete me
in this place of the Forrest, and to couple vs</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. I would faine see this meeting</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Aud</span>. Wel, the Gods giue vs ioy</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Amen. A man may if he were of a fearful heart,
stagger in this attempt: for heere wee haue no Temple
but the wood, no assembly but horne-beasts. But what
though? Courage. As hornes are odious, they are necessarie.
It is said, many a man knowes no end of his goods;
right: Many a man has good Hornes, and knows no end
of them. Well, that is the dowrie of his wife, 'tis none
of his owne getting; hornes, euen so poore men alone:
No, no, the noblest Deere hath them as huge as the Rascall:
Is the single man therefore blessed? No, as a wall'd
Towne is more worthier then a village, so is the forehead
of a married man, more honourable then the bare
brow of a Batcheller: and by how much defence is better
then no skill, by so much is a horne more precious
then to want.</p>

  <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. I wil not take her on guift of any man</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ol</span>. Truly she must be giuen, or the marriage is not
lawfull</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. Proceed, proceede: Ile giue her</p>

companie, I am verie glad to see you, euen a toy in hand heere Sir:
Nay, pray be couer'd</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. Wil you be married, Motley?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. As the Oxe hath his bow sir, the horse his curb,
and the Falcon her bels, so man hath his desires, and as
Pigeons bill, so wedlocke would be nibling</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. And wil you (being a man of your breeding) be

and haue a good Priest that can tel you what marriage is,
this fellow wil but ioyne you together, as they ioyne
Wainscot, then one of you wil proue a shrunke pannell,

<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. I am not in the minde, but I were better to bee

me wel: and not being wel married, it wil be a good

<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. Goe thou with mee,

that teares do not become a man</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. But haue I not cause to weepe?
  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. As good cause as one would desire,
Therefore weepe</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. His very haire

<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Something browner then Iudasses:
Marrie his kisses are Iudasses owne children</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I'faith his haire is of a good colour</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. An excellent colour:
Your Chessenut was euer the onely colour:
  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. And his kissing is as ful of sanctitie,
As the touch of holy bread</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Hee hath bought a paire of cast lips of Diana: a
Nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiouslie,
the very yce of chastity is in them</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Rosa</span>. But why did hee sweare hee would come this

<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Doe you thinke so?</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Yes, I thinke he is not a picke
purse, nor a horse-stealer, but for his verity in loue, I doe thinke
him as concaue as a couered goblet, or a Worme-eaten nut</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Not true in loue?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Yes, when he is in, but I thinke he is not in</p>

the confirmer of false reckonings, he attends here in the forrest on

But what talke wee of Fathers, when there is such a man

<p>  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. O that's a braue man, hee writes braue verses,
speakes braue words, sweares braue oathes, and breakes

<h3>Scena Quinta.</h3>

<p class="direction">Enter Siluius and Phebe.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. Sweet Phebe doe not scorne me, do not Phebe
Say that you loue me not, but say not so
In bitternesse; the common executioner
Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard
Falls not the axe vpon the humbled neck,
But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
Then he that dies and liues by bloody drops?
Enter Rosalind, Celia, and Corin.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Phe</span>. I would not be thy executioner,
I flye thee, for I would not iniure thee:
Thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye,
'Tis pretty sure, and very probable,
That eyes that are the frailst, and softest things,
Who shut their coward gates on atomyes,
Should be called tyrants, butchers, murtherers.
Now I doe frowne on thee with all my heart,
And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
Now counterfeit to swound, why now fall downe,
Or if thou canst not, oh for shame, for shame,
Lye not, to say mine eyes are murtherers:
Now shew the wound mine eye hath made in thee,
Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remaines
Some scarre of it: Leane vpon a rush
The Cicatrice and capable impressure
Thy palme some moment keepes: but now mine eyes
Which I haue darted at thee, hurt thee not,
Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes
That can doe hurt</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. O deere Phebe,
If euer (as that euer may be neere)
You meet in some fresh cheeke the power of fancie,
Then shall you know the wounds inuisible
That Loues keene arrows make</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Phe</span>. But till that time
Come not thou neere me: and when that time comes,
Afflict me with thy mockes, pitty me not,
As till that time I shall not pitty thee</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. And why I pray you? who might be
your mother That you insult, exult, and all at once Ouer the wretched?
what though you haue no beauty As by my faith, I see no more in you
Then without Candle may goe darke to bed: Must you be therefore prowd
and pittilesse?  Why what meanes this? why do you looke on me?  I see
no more in you then in the ordinary Of Natures sale-worke? 'ods my
little life, I thinke she meanes to tangle my eies too: No faith proud
Mistresse, hope not after it, 'Tis not your inkie browes, your blacke
silke haire, Your bugle eye-balls, nor your cheeke of creame That can
entame my spirits to your worship: You foolish Shepheard, wherefore do
you follow her Like foggy South, puffing with winde and raine, You are
a thousand times a properer man Then she a woman. 'Tis such fooles as
you That makes the world full of ill-fauourd children: 'Tis not her
glasse, but you that flatters her, And out of you she sees her selfe
more proper Then any of her lineaments can show her: But Mistris, know
your selfe, downe on your knees And thanke heauen, fasting, for a good
mans loue; For I must tell you friendly in your eare, Sell when you
can, you are not for all markets: Cry the man mercy, loue him, take
his offer, Foule is most foule, being foule to be a scoffer.  So take
her to thee Shepheard, fareyouwell</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Phe</span>. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a
yere together, I had rather here you chide, then this man wooe</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Hees falne in loue with your
foulnesse, &amp; shee'll Fall in loue with my anger. If it be so, as
fast As she answeres thee with frowning lookes, ile sauce Her with
bitter words: why looke you so vpon me?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Phe</span>. For no ill will I beare you</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I pray you do not fall in loue
with mee, For I am falser then vowes made in wine: Besides, I like you
not: if you will know my house, 'Tis at the tufft of Oliues, here hard
by: Will you goe Sister? Shepheard ply her hard: Come Sister:
Shepheardesse, looke on him better And be not proud, though all the
world could see, None could be so abus'd in sight as hee.  Come, to
our flocke, Enter.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Phe</span>. Dead Shepheard, now I find thy saw of might,
Who euer lov'd, that lou'd not at first sight?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. Sweet Phebe</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Phe</span>. Hah: what saist thou Siluius?
  <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. Sweet Phebe pitty me</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Phe</span>. Why I am sorry for thee gentle Siluius</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. Where euer sorrow is, reliefe
would be: If you doe sorrow at my griefe in loue, By giuing loue your
sorrow, and my griefe Were both extermin'd</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Phe</span>. Thou hast my loue, is not that
neighbourly?  <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. I would haue you</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Phe</span>. Why that were couetousnesse:
Siluius; the time was, that I hated thee; And yet it is not, that I
beare thee loue, But since that thou canst talke of loue so well, Thy
company, which erst was irkesome to me I will endure; and Ile employ
thee too: But doe not looke for further recompence Then thine owne
gladnesse, that thou art employd</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. So holy, and so perfect is my
loue, And I in such a pouerty of grace, That I shall thinke it a most
plenteous crop To gleane the broken eares after the man That the maine
haruest reapes: loose now and then A scattred smile, and that Ile liue
vpon</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Phe</span>. Knowst thou the youth that spoke to mee yerewhile?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. Not very well, but I haue met him oft,
And he hath bought the Cottage and the bounds
That the old Carlot once was Master of</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Phe</span>. Thinke not I loue him, though I ask for him,
'Tis but a peeuish boy, yet he talkes well,
But what care I for words? yet words do well
When he that speakes them pleases those that heare:
It is a pretty youth, not very prettie,
But sure hee's proud, and yet his pride becomes him;
Hee'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
Is his complexion: and faster then his tongue
Did make offence, his eye did heale it vp:
He is not very tall, yet for his yeeres hee's tall:
His leg is but so so, and yet 'tis well:
There was a pretty rednesse in his lip,
A little riper, and more lustie red
Then that mixt in his cheeke: 'twas iust the difference
Betwixt the constant red, and mingled Damaske.
There be some women Siluius, had they markt him
In parcells as I did, would haue gone neere
To fall in loue with him: but for my part
I loue him not, nor hate him not: and yet
Haue more cause to hate him then to loue him,
For what had he to doe to chide at me?
He said mine eyes were black, and my haire blacke,
And now I am remembred, scorn'd at me:
I maruell why I answer'd not againe,
But that's all one: omittance is no quittance:
Ile write to him a very tanting Letter,
And thou shalt beare it, wilt thou Siluius?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. Phebe, with all my heart</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Phe</span>. Ile write it strait:
The matter's in my head, and in my heart,
I will be bitter with him, and passing short;
Goe with me Siluius.</p>

<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. They say you are a melancholly fellow</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. I am so: I doe loue it better then laughing</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Those that are in extremity of either, are abhominable

<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Why then 'tis good to be a poste</p>

fantasticall; nor the Courtiers, which is proud: nor the Souldiers,
which is ambitious: nor the Lawiers, which is politick: nor the
Ladies, which is nice: nor the Louers, which is all these: but it is a
melancholy of mine owne, compounded of many simples, extracted from
many obiects, and indeed the sundrie contemplation of my trauells, in
which by often rumination, wraps me in a most humorous sadnesse</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. A Traueller: by my faith you haue great reason
to be sad: I feare you haue sold your owne Lands,
to see other mens; then to haue seene much, and to haue

<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. Yes, I haue gain'd my experience.

then you make a woman: besides, he brings his destinie
with him</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. What's that?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Why hornes: w such as you are faine to be beholding
to your wiues for: but he comes armed in his
fortune, and preuents the slander of his wife</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Vertue is no horne-maker: and my Rosalind is
vertuous</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. And I am your Rosalind</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. It pleases him to call you so: but he hath a Rosalind
of a better leere then you</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Come, wooe me, wooe mee: for now I am in a
holy-day humor, and like enough to consent: What
would you say to me now, and I were your verie, verie
Rosalind?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I would kisse before I spoke</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Nay, you were better speake first, and when you
were grauel'd, for lacke of matter, you might take occasion
to kisse: verie good Orators when they are out,
they will spit, and for louers, lacking (God warne vs)
matter, the cleanliest shift is to kisse</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. How if the kisse be denide?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Then she puts you to entreatie, and there begins
new matter</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Who could be out, being before his beloued
Mistris?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Marrie that should you if I were your Mistris,
or I should thinke my honestie ranker then my wit</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. What, of my suite?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Not out of your apparrell, and yet out of your
suite:
Am not I your Rosalind?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I take some ioy to say you are, because I would
be talking of her</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Well, in her person, I say I will not haue you</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Then in mine owne person, I die</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. No faith, die by Attorney: the poore world is
almost six thousand yeeres old, and in all this time there
was not anie man died in his owne person (videlicet) in
a loue cause: Troilous had his braines dash'd out with a
Grecian club, yet he did what hee could to die before,
and he is one of the patternes of loue. Leander, he would
haue liu'd manie a faire yeere though Hero had turn'd
Nun; if it had not bin for a hot Midsomer-night, for
(good youth) he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont,
and being taken with the crampe, was droun'd,
and the foolish Chronoclers of that age, found it was
Hero of Cestos. But these are all lies, men haue died
from time to time, and wormes haue eaten them, but not
for loue</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I would not haue my right Rosalind of this mind,
for I protest her frowne might kill me</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. By this hand, it will not kill a flie: but come,
now I will be your Rosalind in a more comming-on disposition:
and aske me what you will, I will grant it</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Then loue me Rosalind</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Yes faith will I, fridaies and saterdaies, and all</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. And wilt thou haue me?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I, and twentie such</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. What saiest thou?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Are you not good?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I hope so</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Rosalind</span>. Why then, can one desire too much of a
good thing: Come sister, you shall be the Priest, and
marrie vs: giue me your hand Orlando: What doe you
say sister?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Pray thee marrie vs</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. I cannot say the words</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. You must begin, will you Orlando</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Goe too: wil you Orlando, haue to wife this Rosalind?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I will</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I, but when?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Why now, as fast as she can marrie vs</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Then you must say, I take thee Rosalind for
wife</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I take thee Rosalind for wife</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I might aske you for your Commission,
But I doe take thee Orlando for my husband: there's a
girle goes before the Priest, and certainely a Womans
thought runs before her actions</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. So do all thoughts, they are wing'd</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Now tell me how long you would haue her, after
you haue possest her?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. For euer, and a day</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Say a day, without the euer: no, no Orlando, men
are Aprill when they woe, December when they wed:
Maides are May when they are maides, but the sky changes
when they are wiues: I will bee more iealous of
thee, then a Barbary cocke-pidgeon ouer his hen, more
clamorous then a Parrat against raine, more new-fangled
then an ape, more giddy in my desires, then a monkey:
I will weepe for nothing, like Diana in the Fountaine,
&amp; I wil do that when you are dispos'd to be merry:
I will laugh like a Hyen, and that when thou art inclin'd
to sleepe</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. But will my Rosalind doe so?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. By my life, she will doe as I doe</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. O but she is wise</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Or else shee could not haue the wit to doe this:
the wiser, the waywarder: make the doores vpon a womans
wit, and it will out at the casement: shut that, and
'twill out at the key-hole: stop that, 'twill flie with the
smoake out at the chimney</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might
say, wit whether wil't?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Nay, you might keepe that checke for it, till you
met your wiues wit going to your neighbours bed</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. And what wit could wit haue, to excuse that?
  Rosa. Marry to say, she came to seeke you there: you
shall neuer take her without her answer, vnlesse you take
her without her tongue: o that woman that cannot
make her fault her husbands occasion, let her neuer nurse
her childe her selfe, for she will breed it like a foole</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. For these two houres Rosalinde, I wil leaue thee</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Alas, deere loue, I cannot lacke thee two houres</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I must attend the Duke at dinner, by two a clock
I will be with thee againe</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I, goe your waies, goe your waies: I knew what
you would proue, my friends told mee as much, and I
thought no lesse: that flattering tongue of yours wonne
me: 'tis but one cast away, and so come death: two o'
clocke is your howre</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I, sweet Rosalind</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God
mend mee, and by all pretty oathes that are not dangerous,
if you breake one iot of your promise, or come one
minute behinde your houre, I will thinke you the most
patheticall breake-promise, and the most hollow louer,
and the most vnworthy of her you call Rosalinde, that
may bee chosen out of the grosse band of the vnfaithfull:
therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. With no lesse religion, then if thou wert indeed
my Rosalind: so adieu</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Well, Time is the olde Iustice that examines all
such offenders, and let time try: adieu.
Enter.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. You haue simply misus'd our sexe in your loue-prate:
we must haue your doublet and hose pluckt ouer
your head, and shew the world what the bird hath done
to her owne neast</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. O coz, coz, coz: my pretty little coz, that thou
didst know how many fathome deepe I am in loue: but
it cannot bee sounded: my affection hath an vnknowne
bottome, like the Bay of Portugall</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Or rather bottomlesse, that as fast as you poure
affection in, it runs out</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. No, that same wicked Bastard of Venus, that was
begot of thought, conceiu'd of spleene, and borne of
madnesse, that blinde rascally boy, that abuses euery
ones eyes, because his owne are out, let him bee iudge,
how deepe I am in loue: ile tell thee Aliena, I cannot be
out of the sight of Orlando: Ile goe finde a shadow, and
sigh till he come</p>

<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. How say you now, is it not past two a clock?
And heere much Orlando</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. I warrant you, with pure loue, &amp; troubled brain,</p>
<p class="direction">Enter Siluius.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Cel</span>. He hath t'ane his bow and arrowes, and is gone forth
To sleepe: looke who comes heere</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. My errand is to you, faire youth,
My gentle Phebe, did bid me giue you this:
I know not the contents, but as I guesse
By the sterne brow, and waspish action
Which she did vse, as she was writing of it,
It beares an angry tenure; pardon me,
I am but as a guiltlesse messenger</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Patience her selfe would startle at this letter,
And play the swaggerer, beare this, beare all:
Shee saies I am not faire, that I lacke manners,
She calls me proud, and that she could not loue me
Were man as rare as Phenix: 'od's my will,
Her loue is not the Hare that I doe hunt,
Why writes she so to me? well Shepheard, well,
This is a Letter of your owne deuice</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. No, I protest, I know not the contents,
Phebe did write it</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Come, come, you are a foole,
And turn'd into the extremity of loue.
I saw her hand, she has a leatherne hand,
A freestone coloured hand: I verily did thinke
That her old gloues were on, but twas her hands:
She has a huswiues hand, but that's no matter:
I say she neuer did inuent this letter,
This is a mans inuention, and his hand</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. Sure it is hers</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Why, tis a boysterous and a cruell stile,
A stile for challengers: why, she defies me,
Like Turke to Christian: womens gentle braine
Could not drop forth such giant rude inuention,
Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect
Then in their countenance: will you heare the letter?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. So please you, for I neuer heard it yet:
Yet heard too much of Phebes crueltie</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. She Phebes me: marke how the tyrant writes.</p>
<p class="direction">Read.</p>
<p> <span class="speaker">Ros</span>.Art thou god, to Shepherd turn'd?
That a maidens heart hath burn'd.
Can a woman raile thus?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. Call you this railing?</p>
<p class="direction">Read.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Ros</span>.Why, thy godhead laid a part,
War'st thou with a womans heart?
Did you euer heare such railing?
Whiles the eye of man did wooe me,
That could do no vengeance to me.
Meaning me a beast.
If the scorne of your bright eine
Haue power to raise such loue in mine,
Alacke, in me, what strange effect
Would they worke in milde aspect?
Whiles you chid me, I did loue,
How then might your praiers moue?
He that brings this loue to thee,
Little knowes this Loue in me:
And by him seale vp thy minde,
Whether that thy youth and kinde
Will the faithfull offer take
Of me, and all that I can make,
Or else by him my loue denie,
And then Ile studie how to die</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Sil</span>. Call you this chiding?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Alas poore Shepheard</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Doe you pitty him? No, he deserues no pitty:
wilt thou loue such a woman? what to make thee an instrument,
and play false straines vpon thee? not to be endur'd.
Well, goe your way to her; (for I see Loue hath
made thee a tame snake) and say this to her; That if she
loue me, I charge her to loue thee: if she will not, I will
neuer haue her, vnlesse thou intreat for her: if you bee a
true louer hence, and not a word; for here comes more
company.</p>

<p class="direction">Enter Oliuer.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Oliu</span>. Good morrow, faire ones: pray you, (if you  know)
Where in the Purlews of this Forrest, stands
A sheep-coat, fenc'd about with Oliue-trees</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom
The ranke of Oziers, by the murmuring streame
Left on your right hand, brings you to the place:
But at this howre, the house doth keepe it selfe,
There's none within</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
Then should I know you by description,
Such garments, and such yeeres: the boy is faire,
Of femall fauour, and bestowes himselfe
Like a ripe sister: the woman low
And browner then her brother: are not you
The owner of the house I did enquire for?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Orlando doth commend him to you both,
And to that youth hee calls his Rosalind,
He sends this bloudy napkin; are you he?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I am: what must we vnderstand by this?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Some of my shame, if you will know of me
What man I am, and how, and why, and where
This handkercher was stain'd</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. I pray you tell it</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. When last the yong Orlando parted from you,
He left a promise to returne againe
Within an houre, and pacing through the Forrest,
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancie,
Loe what befell: he threw his eye aside,
And marke what obiect did present it selfe
Vnder an old Oake, whose bows were moss'd with age
And high top, bald with drie antiquitie:
A wretched ragged man, ore-growne with haire
Lay sleeping on his back; about his necke
A greene and guilded snake had wreath'd it selfe,
Who with her head, nimble in threats approach'd
The opening of his mouth: but sodainly
Seeing Orlando, it vnlink'd it selfe,
And with indented glides, did slip away
Into a bush, vnder which bushes shade
A Lyonnesse, with vdders all drawne drie,
Lay cowching head on ground, with catlike watch
When that the sleeping man should stirre; for 'tis
The royall disposition of that beast
To prey on nothing, that doth seeme as dead:
This seene, Orlando did approach the man,
And found it was his brother, his elder brother</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. O I haue heard him speake of that same brother,
And he did render him the most vnnaturall
That liu'd amongst men</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. And well he might so doe,
For well I know he was vnnaturall</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. But to Orlando: did he leaue him there
Food to the suck'd and hungry Lyonnesse?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Twice did he turne his backe, and purpos'd so:
But kindnesse, nobler euer then reuenge,
And Nature stronger then his iust occasion,
Made him giue battell to the Lyonnesse:
Who quickly fell before him, in which hurtling
From miserable slumber I awaked</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Are you his brother?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Was't you he rescu'd?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Was't you that did so oft contriue to kill him?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. 'Twas I: but 'tis not I: I doe not shame
To tell you what I was, since my conuersion
So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. But for the bloody napkin?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. By and by:
When from the first to last betwixt vs two,
Teares our recountments had most kindely bath'd,
As how I came into that Desert place.
In briefe, he led me to the gentle Duke,
Who gaue me fresh aray, and entertainment,
Committing me vnto my brothers loue,
Who led me instantly vnto his Caue,
There stript himselfe, and heere vpon his arme
The Lyonnesse had torne some flesh away,
Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
And cride in fainting vpon Rosalinde.
Briefe, I recouer'd him, bound vp his wound,
And after some small space, being strong at heart,
He sent me hither, stranger as I am
To tell this story, that you might excuse
His broken promise, and to giue this napkin
Died in this bloud, vnto the Shepheard youth,
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Why how now Ganimed, sweet Ganimed</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Many will swoon when they do look on bloud</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. There is more in it; Cosen Ganimed</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Looke, he recouers</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I would I were at home</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Wee'll lead you thither:
I pray you will you take him by the arme</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Be of good cheere youth: you a man?
You lacke a mans heart</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I doe so, I confesse it:
Ah, sirra, a body would thinke this was well counterfeited,
I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited:
heigh-ho</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. This was not counterfeit, there is too great testimony
in your complexion, that it was a passion of earnest</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Counterfeit, I assure you</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to
be a man</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. So I doe: but yfaith, I should haue beene a woman
by right</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Cel</span>. Come, you looke paler and paler: pray you draw
homewards: good sir, goe with vs</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Oli</span>. That will I: for I must beare answere backe
How you excuse my brother, Rosalind</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I shall deuise something: but I pray you commend
my counterfeiting to him: will you goe?</p>

<h3>Scoena Secunda.</h3>
<p class="direction">Enter Orlando &amp; Oliuer.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Is't possible, that on so little acquaintance you
should like her? that, but seeing, you should loue her?
And louing woo? and wooing, she should graunt? And
will you perseuer to enioy her?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ol</span>. Neither call the giddinesse of it in question; the
pouertie of her, the small acquaintance, my sodaine woing,
nor sodaine consenting: but say with mee, I loue
Aliena: say with her, that she loues mee; consent with
both, that we may enioy each other: it shall be to your
good: for my fathers house, and all the reuennew, that
was old Sir Rowlands will I estate vpon you, and heere
liue and die a Shepherd.</p>
<p class="direction">Enter Rosalind.</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. You haue my consent.
Let your Wedding be to morrow: thither will I
Inuite the Duke, and all's contented followers:
Go you, and prepare Aliena; for looke you,
Heere comes my Rosalinde</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. God saue you brother</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ol</span>. And you faire sister</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Oh my deere Orlando, how it greeues me to see
thee weare thy heart in a scarfe</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. It is my arme</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I thought thy heart had beene wounded with
the clawes of a Lion</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a Lady</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeyted
to sound, when he shew'd me your handkercher?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I, and greater wonders then that</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. O, I know where you are: nay, tis true: there
was neuer any thing so sodaine, but the sight of two
Rammes, and Cesars Thrasonicall bragge of I came, saw,
and ouercome. For your brother, and my sister, no sooner
met, but they look'd: no sooner look'd, but they
lou'd; no sooner lou'd, but they sigh'd: no sooner sigh'd
but they ask'd one another the reason: no sooner knew
the reason, but they sought the remedie: and in these
degrees, haue they made a paire of staires to marriage,
which they will climbe incontinent, or else bee incontinent
before marriage; they are in the verie wrath of
loue, and they will together. Clubbes cannot part
them</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. They shall be married to morrow: and I will
bid the Duke to the Nuptiall. But O, how bitter a thing
it is, to looke into happines through another mans eies:
by so much the more shall I to morrow be at the height
of heart heauinesse, by how much I shal thinke my brother
happie, in hauing what he wishes for</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Why then to morrow, I cannot serue your turne
for Rosalind?
  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. I can liue no longer by thinking</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. I will wearie you then no longer with idle talking.
Know of me then (for now I speake to some purpose)
that I know you are a Gentleman of good conceit:
I speake not this, that you should beare a good opinion
of my knowledge: insomuch (I say) I know you are: neither
do I labor for a greater esteeme then may in some
little measure draw a beleefe from you, to do your selfe
good, and not to grace me. Beleeue then, if you please,
that I can do strange things: I haue since I was three
yeare old conuerst with a Magitian, most profound in
his Art, and yet not damnable. If you do loue Rosalinde
so neere the hart, as your gesture cries it out: when your
brother marries Aliena, shall you marrie her. I know into
what straights of Fortune she is driuen, and it is not
impossible to me, if it appeare not inconuenient to you,
to set her before your eyes to morrow, humane as she is,
and without any danger</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. Speak'st thou in sober meanings?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. By my life I do, which I tender deerly, though
I say I am a Magitian: Therefore put you in your best aray,
bid your friends: for if you will be married to morrow,
you shall: and to Rosalind if you will.</p>

All made of passion, and all made of wishes,
All adoration, dutie, and obseruance,
All humblenesse, all patience, and impatience,

<p>  <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. If this be so, why blame you me to loue you?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Why do you speake too, Why blame you mee
to loue you</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Orl</span>. To her, that is not heere, nor doth not heare</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. Pray you no more of this, 'tis like the howling
of Irish Wolues against the Moone: I will helpe you
if I can: I would loue you if I could: To morrow meet
me altogether: I wil marrie you, if euer I marrie Woman,
and Ile be married to morrow: I will satisfie you,
if euer I satisfi'd man, and you shall bee married to morrow.
I wil content you, if what pleases you contents
you, and you shal be married to morrow: As you loue
Rosalind meet, as you loue Phebe meet, and as I loue no
woman, Ile meet: so fare you wel: I haue left you commands</p>

the Forrest: he hath bin a Courtier he sweares</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. If any man doubt that, let him put mee to my
purgation, I haue trod a measure, I haue flattred a Lady,
I haue bin politicke with my friend, smooth with mine
enemie, I haue vndone three Tailors, I haue had foure
quarrels, and like to haue fought one</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. And how was that tane vp?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. 'Faith we met, and found the quarrel was vpon
the seuenth cause</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. How seuenth cause? Good my Lord, like this
fellow</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Du.Se</span>. I like him very well</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. God'ild you sir, I desire you of the like: I presse
in heere sir, amongst the rest of the Country copulatiues
to sweare, and to forsweare, according as mariage binds
and blood breakes: a poore virgin sir, an il-fauor'd thing
sir, but mine owne, a poore humour of mine sir, to take
that that no man else will: rich honestie dwels like a miser
sir, in a poore house, as your Pearle in your foule oyster</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Du.Se</span>. By my faith, he is very swift, and sententious</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. According to the fooles bolt sir, and such dulcet
diseases</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. But for the seuenth cause. How did you finde
the quarrell on the seuenth cause?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. Vpon a lye, seuen times remoued: (beare your
bodie more seeming Audry) as thus sir: I did dislike the
cut of a certaine Courtiers beard: he sent me word, if I
said his beard was not cut well, hee was in the minde it
was: this is call'd the retort courteous. If I sent him
word againe, it was not well cut, he wold send me word
he cut it to please himselfe: this is call'd the quip modest.
If againe, it was not well cut, he disabled my iudgment:
this is called, the reply churlish. If againe it was not well
cut, he would answer I spake not true: this is call'd the
reproofe valiant. If againe, it was not well cut, he wold
say, I lie: this is call'd the counter-checke quarrelsome:
and so to lye circumstantiall, and the lye direct</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. And how oft did you say his beard was not well
cut?</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. I durst go no further then the lye circumstantial:
nor he durst not giue me the lye direct: and so wee measur'd
swords, and parted</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. Can you nominate in order now, the degrees of
the lye</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Clo</span>. O sir, we quarrel in print, by the booke: as you
haue bookes for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
The first, the Retort courteous: the second, the
Quip-modest: the third, the reply Churlish: the fourth,
the Reproofe valiant: the fift, the Counterchecke quarrelsome:
the sixt, the Lye with circumstance: the seauenth,
the Lye direct: all these you may auoyd, but the
Lye direct: and you may auoide that too, with an If. I
knew when seuen Iustices could not take vp a Quarrell,
but when the parties were met themselues, one of them
thought but of an If; as if you saide so, then I saide so:
and they shooke hands, and swore brothers. Your If, is
the onely peace-maker: much vertue in if</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. Is not this a rare fellow my Lord? He's as good

I am the second sonne of old Sir Rowland,
That bring these tidings to this faire assembly.
Duke Frederick hearing how that euerie day
Men of great worth resorted to this forrest,
Addrest a mightie power, which were on foote
In his owne conduct, purposely to take
His brother heere, and put him to the sword:
And to the skirts of this wilde Wood he came;
Where, meeting with an old Religious man,
After some question with him, was conuerted
Both from his enterprize, and from the world:
His crowne bequeathing to his banish'd Brother,
And all their Lands restor'd to him againe
That were with him exil'd. This to be true,
I do engage my life</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Du.Se</span>. Welcome yong man:
Thou offer'st fairely to thy brothers wedding:
To one his lands with-held, and to the other
A land it selfe at large, a potent Dukedome.
First, in this Forrest, let vs do those ends
That heere were well begun, and wel begot:
And after, euery of this happie number
That haue endur'd shrew'd daies, and nights with vs,
Shal share the good of our returned fortune,
According to the measure of their states.
Meane time, forget this new-falne dignitie,
And fall into our Rusticke Reuelrie:
Play Musicke, and you Brides and Bride-groomes all,
With measure heap'd in ioy, to'th Measures fall</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly,
The Duke hath put on a Religious life,
And throwne into neglect the pompous Court</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">2.Bro</span>. He hath</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. To him will I: out of these conuertites,
There is much matter to be heard, and learn'd:
you to your former Honor, I bequeath
your patience, and your vertue, well deserues it.
you to a loue, that your true faith doth merit:
you to your land, and loue, and great allies:
you to a long, and well-deserued bed:
And you to wrangling, for thy louing voyage
Is but for two moneths victuall'd: So to your pleasures,
I am for other, then for dancing meazures</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Du.Se</span>. Stay, Iaques, stay</p>
<p>   <span class="speaker">Iaq</span>. To see no pastime, I: what you would haue,
Ile stay to know, at your abandon'd caue.</p>

As we do trust, they'l end in true delights.</p>
<p class="direction">Exit</p>
<p>  <span class="speaker">Ros</span>. It is not the fashion to see the Ladie the Epilogue:
but it is no more vnhandsome, then to see the
Lord the Prologue. If it be true, that good wine needs
no bush, 'tis true, that a good play needes no Epilogue.
Yet to good wine they do vse good bushes: and good
playes proue the better by the helpe of good Epilogues:
What a case am I in then, that am neither a good Epilogue,
nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalfe of a
good play? I am not furnish'd like a Begger, therefore
to begge will not become mee. My way is to coniure
you, and Ile begin with the Women. I charge you (O
women) for the loue you beare to men, to like as much
of this Play, as please you: And I charge you (O men)
for the loue you beare to women (as I perceiue by your
simpring, none of you hates them) that betweene you,
and the women, the play may please. If I were a Woman,
I would kisse as many of you as had beards that
pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that
I defi'de not: And I am sure, as many as haue good
beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will for my kind
offer, when I make curt'sie, bid me farewell.
