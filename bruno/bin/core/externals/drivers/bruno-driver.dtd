<!ELEMENT settings (start,remove,sync-omit,sync-force,smilref-omit,smil-sequence?,smil-customTest?,smil-split,nav-include,mixed-content-handler)> 
<!ELEMENT start (item)> 
<!-- <start> selects the starting element of document content (such as "body", or "book"). All following xpath statements are made relative to this element  -->
<!ELEMENT remove (item*)> 
<!-- <remove> selects elements to be removed completely from output document before processing. -->
<!ELEMENT sync-omit (item*)> 
<!-- <sync-omit> selects elements that shall not become a sync point (aka an element in smil). Note: elements containing ignorable whitespace only are not synced by default, so they need to be mentioned here. -->
<!ELEMENT sync-force (item*)> 
<!-- <sync-force> selects elements that shall become a sync point (aka an element in smil) although brunos default behavior has indicated they should not be. Note: elements containing ignorable whitespace only are not synced by default. -->   
<!ELEMENT smilref-omit (item*)> 
<!-- <smilref-omit> selects elements that should be a sync point (aka an element in smil) but should not have a linkback element/attribute in content document. -->
<!ELEMENT smil-sequence (item*)> 
<!-- <smil-sequence> selecting that should become a wrapping smil time container around a group of children. Typically used for table, tr and other structures that benefit from grouping. The attribute user-escape (true|false) determines whether the sequence should have explicit escapability as per z2004. The content of <smil-sequence> is ignored if output is Daisy 2.02. -->
<!ELEMENT smil-customTest (item*)> 
<!-- <smil-customTest> selected elements that should be skippable, ie have SMIL 2.0 customTests assigned to them. The content of <smil-customTest> is ignored if output is Daisy 2.02 -->
<!ELEMENT smil-split (item*)> 
<!-- <smil-split> selects elements that should force a new physical smil file in output. If there is no item element here, only one smil file will be output, containing the whole presentation. -->
<!ELEMENT nav-include (item*)> 
<!-- <nav-include> selects elements to bring into navigation control document. The attribute "navLabel" contains an xpath statement that points to a relative node (element or text) which will be used for NCX/NCC navlabels. Absence of the navLabel attribute is equal to "./text()", that is, the text of the container itself. -->
<!ELEMENT mixed-content-handler (item*)> 
<!-- <mixed-content-handler> configures Brunos way of handling mixed content models.  -->
<!-- <mixed-content-handler> attlist:
 active: sets mixed content handling globally on or off
 elemName: name of appended element, if append is done during normalization
 elemName: name of attribute on appended element
 elemName: value of attribute on appended element
